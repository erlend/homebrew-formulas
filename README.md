Erlend's Homebrew Formulas
==========================
At the moment the only thing here is **mutt-kz**. I hope to add more soon...

Installation
------------
There are two ways of installing these formulae:

### Using taps *(RECOMMENDED)*

First add the repository to your homebrew taps (you only need to do this once)

    $ brew tap erlend/formulas

Now just use brew as you normally do

    $ brew install mutt-kz --with-notmuch

### Manually
Just want to install one of the formulae and don't want to use taps? Then use
the full url of the formula you want to install.

    $ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erlend/homebrew-formulas/master/mutt-kz.rb
